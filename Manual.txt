Hello there... 
this is Manual to run this Project.

This is application won't  work guys.. Sorry ...

UNTILLLLLLLL

you should enter your Database password and Create a Database called "pma-springbootdb" 
and enter given query in the Query editor.

i give the Security to some pages.. Don't worry Guys I diables them..
If you Want enable them just Follow these
>src>main>java>com>Phonenix>pma>Security>SecurityConfig.java and edit as you want.

Again .. Security works.. but u Can't open the Specific pages
So .. Just Register yourself and assign the Authorities in the DATABASE..

thats it ...
You are in ...
